# Official-Portfolio
Official Portfolio showcasing projects that I have completed and contact information.

The main project highlighted in my portfolio is a ScoreKeeper Application. It was designed to keep track of score in FIFA games, but will eventually include options to customize the layout. It utilizies HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills and knowledge. 

The other projects included in this portfolio include a Color Generator, a number guessing game, a bootstrap project and a Run Buddy landing page, which was worked on during class. 

Contact Information is also available at the bottom of the portfolio.
